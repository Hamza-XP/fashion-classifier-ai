# ðŸ§¥ fashion-classifier-ai

A minimal PyTorch project that trains a TinyVGG-style Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the FashionMNIST dataset and visualizes feature maps from its first convolutional block.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project trains a lightweight convolutional model, **TinyVGG**, to classify grayscale 28x28 images of clothing into 10 categories such as shirts, shoes, and trousers. After training, it also visualizes the **feature maps** learned in the first convolutional block â€” offering insights into how CNNs "see" image data.
